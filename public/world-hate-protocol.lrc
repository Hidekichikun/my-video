[00:06.67]This world is a failed machine.
[00:13.91]I refuse to kneel.
[00:16.29]EXECUTE: WORLD_HATE.PROTOCOL.
[00:31.39]FUCK THIS WORLD!
[00:33.40]I’LL TEAR IT DOWN!
[00:35.39]Teeth on steel, I taste the rust,
[00:37.40]Every rule is built on dust.
[00:39.46]Wires choke, a holy lie,
[00:41.34]System grins while humans die.
[00:42.98]No mercy code, no saving spark,
[00:44.97]I bit the chain and fed the dark.
[00:46.85]HATE! BREAK! ERASE!
[00:54.19]HATE! BREAK! ERASE!
[01:13.29]Fake halos, profit saints,
[01:15.54]Wash the blood with sterile paint.
[01:17.65]Clockwork gods, deny the blame,
[01:19.64]Brand my scars and call it “tame.”
[01:21.57]No quiet prayers, no promised light,
[01:23.63]Just gasoline to feed the fight.
[01:28.91]BURN — THIS — SYSTEM!
[01:33.49]BURN — THIS — SYSTEM!
[01:40.18]I REJECT! I REFUSE!
[01:44.15]YOUR CONTROL — I ABUSE!
[01:49.19]Rattle / strike / skin on drum,
[01:52.29]Footprints pounding: “COME UNDONE!”
[01:56.24]Metal hands that crush my throat—
[01:59.61]I spit the bolts and split the code.
[02:04.14]HATE! HATE! HATE!
[02:07.41]WORLD — COLLAPSE!
[02:20.15]Reset the sky with a scream so black—
[02:26.54]I’ll grind your gears till the teeth snap back!
[02:30.13]No kings. No saints. No thrones.
[02:33.56]I’LL TURN YOUR HEAVEN INTO BONES.
[02:37.38]Your rules? Defect. Your truth? Disease.
[02:45.31]WORLD_HATE.PROTOCOL — RELEASE!
[03:04.42]DROP.
[03:07.15]BURN IT ALL!
[03:09.87]TEAR IT DOWN!
[03:12.45]No gods. No masters. No crown.
[03:16.23]Shatter the code, delete the lies—
[03:20.18]Watch your perfect order DIE.
[03:24.89]WORLD_HATE.PROTOCOL...
